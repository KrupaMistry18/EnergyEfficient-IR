D1	Introduction to Neural Networks	Neural networks are machine learning models inspired by biological neurons. They are used for image recognition, NLP, and many other tasks.
D2	Support Vector Machines	SVMs are supervised machine learning models that analyze data for classification and regression analysis.
D3	Convolutional Neural Networks	CNNs are specialized neural networks for processing data with a grid-like topology, such as images, using convolutional layers.
D4	Recommender Systems Overview	Recommender systems suggest items to users based on preferences and behaviors, using collaborative or content-based filtering.
D5	Dimensionality Reduction Techniques	PCA and t-SNE reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving important structure for visualization and efficiency.
